    </div><h1>Wikipedia - The Free Encyclopedia</h1>

<p>Wikipedia is one of the most remarkable and influential websites on the internet today. It has revolutionized how people access information around the world.</p>
<p>Launched in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit and contribute to.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia is dynamic and constantly updated by a global community of volunteers.</p>
<p>The site offers articles on nearly every topic imaginable, from science and history to pop culture and technology.</p>
<p>One of its strongest features is the collaborative editing system that allows for quick updates and improvements.</p>
<p>With millions of articles in over 300 languages, Wikipedia is accessible to users all over the world.</p>
<p>Its open-source nature has inspired the development of other collaborative knowledge projects.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has become a primary reference point for students, teachers, researchers, and casual learners.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about accuracy, studies have shown that Wikipedia can be as reliable as traditional encyclopedias.</p>
<p>The site is supported by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, which relies on donations to keep the platform ad-free and accessible.</p>
<p>It has also introduced sister projects such as Wikimedia Commons, Wikibooks, and Wikivoyage.</p>
<p>Wikipedia emphasizes neutrality and verifiability, encouraging contributors to cite reliable sources.</p>
<p>It serves as a great example of what a decentralized and democratic knowledge platform can achieve.</p>
<p>Many institutions and scholars now consider Wikipedia as a valuable starting point for research.</p>
<p>With a vast range of contributors, the content often reflects a balance of global perspectives.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has even been preserved in various offline formats for use in remote or disconnected areas.</p>
<p>Its influence extends beyond education — it's also part of digital activism, journalism, and policy discussions.</p>
<p>Schools and universities around the world use Wikipedia to teach students about collaboration and citation.</p>
<p>The site continues to evolve with new technologies and efforts to fight misinformation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Wikipedia has become a symbol of open knowledge and collective intelligence in the digital age.</p>
